                  The Black Death (or Bubonic Plague) was one of the most
                  catastrophic pandemics in the world. Its origin is somewhere
                  in Central Asia, which was disrupted by the expansion of the
                  Mongol Empire in the 13th and 14th centuries. Indeed, the
                  pandemic struck China, India, Persia, Syria and Egypt in the
                  early 1340s.The people who gathered on the docks of Messina to
                  welcome the merchant ships saw with dismay that most of the
                  sailors were dead and those who were still alive were
                  seriously ill. It was characterized by large painful buboes
                  (swelling of the lymph nodes), as well as blackened skin
                  patches, high fever and sometimes coughing up blood. The
                  authorities then ordered the ships to return to sea
                  immediately, but it was already too late.

                  Many scientists believe that this bacterium spread so rapidly
                  to different communities during the fourteenth century as it
                  morphed in some areas into pneumonic strains, which infected
                  people’s respiratory systems . This enabled the disease to
                  spread more quickly amongst people through cough and sneeze
                  droplets, making it more contagious and deadly. The Black
                  Death spread at a time of growing societal interconnections,
                  including long-distance trade, ironically, facilitated by the
                  Mongols, whose empire extended over 6,000 miles across the
                  Eurasian landmass by the early 1300s. Also, people did not
                  have immunity to this disease. The last outbreak of the plague
                  had occured some 700 years earlier, so for the
                  fourteenth-century Eurasian population, this was a new
                  disease. The earliest recorded outbreak of this disease
                  occurred in Hubei province in Mongol-ruled China, sometime in
                  the early 1330s, before spreading to the rest of China. From
                  there, it travelled in a westerly direction, traversing the
                  major overland and sea trade routes, affecting societies in
                  Central Asia, the ‘Middle East’, and eventually reaching the
                  Mediterranean region by 1347/1348. Once reaching the
                  Mediterranean region, it then travelled by ship to major port
                  cities, such as Cairo, Alexandria, Marseilles, and the Italian
                  city-states, including Venice and Genoa. From these bustling
                  port cities, the disease then ‘proceeded to penetrate almost
                  all of Europe, [North Africa] and the Near East along routes
                  radiating inland from the seaports.

                  The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019 can be compared to
                  the Black Death in several respects. Although caused by a
                  virus, not a bacterium, COVID-19 is a novel virus for our
                  generation, as the Black Death was for the fourteenth century.
                  Therefore, we have no immunity to this virus. In terms of
                  symptoms, although there remain key differences,
                  interestingly, there are comparisons too. Although COVID-19
                  presents more like the flu than bubonic plague did, with
                  fever, body aches, a dry cough and nasal congestion amongst
                  other symptoms, the worst cases of COVID-19 have died after
                  experiencing a continuous cough, high fever and difficulty
                  breathing, similar to the pneumonic versions of the plague.
                  Also, similar to pneumonic plague, COVID-19 is transmitted
                  from infected people to others in close proximity, primarily
                  through a cough or sneeze, or by touching contaminated
                  surfaces, where the virus is then absorbed by an uninfected
                  person when they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.
                </p>

                  It is also believed that COVID-19 had its first outbreak in
                  Hubei province, China, where the Black Death began. The first
                  known cluster of cases was traced to an area in the city of
                  Wuhan, with early theories linking it to a ‘wet market’ in
                  this city that sold fresh (including live) species of animals,
                  including exotic species, for consumption and use in
                  traditional medicine preparations. Similar to the Black Death,
                  many believe COVID-19 to be caused by a zoonotic disease
                  spread from infected animals to humans, which has explained
                  the origins of other disease outbreaks in recent years.
                  Presently, the working theory postulates that COVID-19 likely
                  spread from bats and/or pangolins to humans, though this
                  theory has not yet been proven.

                  Analogous to the Black Death, COVID-19 circulated within China
                  before spreading elsewhere. During the first few weeks of
                  January 2020, it spread rapidly to neighbouring countries,
                  such as South Korea, Thailand, Japan and Taiwan, and then
                  further afield to the United States. By the end of January,
                  the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared a global
                  public health emergency, with new cases in Europe, the United
                  Kingdom, Russia, Sweden, and the United Arab Emirates (Taylor
                  2020). A couple of weeks later, it had reached Egypt and
                  Algeria by 14 and 17 February, respectively; Brazil by 26
                  February and South Africa by 5 March as a result of infected
                  travellers returning from ‘hotspot’ areas in Asia, Europe and
                  the United States. Unlike the Black Death, which reached most
                  of AfroEurasia via overland and oceanic routes, COVID-19
                  travelled much more rapidly across the world due to
                  international air travel. On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared
                  COVID-19 a global pandemic.

                  To resume, both pandemics had their origins in ‘the East’,
                  devastating communities across Asia and Europe, forcing people
                  into lockdowns and quarantines. It also severely affected the
                  economies of Asia and Europe. But there were differences too.
                  COVID-19 is occurring in an age of digital technologies, which
                  has encouraged a wider awareness of the disease and its impact
                  than only via word of mouth. These similarities and
                  differences also allude to how societies reacted and responded
                  to pandemics in diverse geopolitical settings, in different
                  times and space. But, what about variant ?

                  <strong>&#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 &#160 The COVID-19 virus variant.</strong>
                  All viruses – including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – evolve
                  over time. When a virus replicates or makes copies of itself,
                  it sometimes changes a little bit, which is normal for a
                  virus. These changes are called “mutations”. A virus with one
                  or more new mutations is referred to as a “variant” of the
                  original virus. When a virus is widely circulating in a
                  population and causing many infections, the likelihood of the
                  virus mutating increases. The more opportunities a virus has
                  to spread, the more it replicates – and the more opportunities
                  it has to undergo changes. Most viral mutations have little to
                  no impact on the virus’s ability to cause infections and
                  disease. But depending on where the changes are located in the
                  virus’s genetic material, they may affect a virus’s
                  properties, such as transmission (for example, it may spread
                  more or less easily) or severity (for example, it may cause
                  more or less severe disease).

                    on vaccines?</strong
                  >
                  The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development or
                  have been approved are expected to provide at least some
                  protection against new virus variants because these vaccines
                  elicit a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies
                  and cells. Therefore, changes or mutations in the virus should
                  not make vaccines completely ineffective. In the event that
                  any of these vaccines prove to be less effective against one
                  or more variants, it will be possible to change the
                  composition of the vaccines to protect against these variants.
                  Data continues to be collected and analysed on new variants of
                  the COVID-19 virus. WHO is working with researchers, health
                  officials and scientists to understand how these variants
                  affect the virus’s behaviour, including their impact on the
                  effectiveness of vaccines, if any. See WHO’s Disease Outbreak
                  News to get up-to-date information on the impact of COVID-19
                  virus variants on the effectiveness of the different vaccines.
                  This is an area where the evidence remains preliminary and is
                  developing quickly. While we are learning more, we need to do
                  everything possible to stop the spread of the virus in order
                  to prevent mutations that may reduce the efficacy of existing
                  vaccines. In addition, manufacturers and the programmes using
                  the vaccines may have to adjust to the evolution of the
                  COVID-19 virus: for example, vaccines may need to incorporate
                  more than one strain when in development, booster shots may be
                  required, and other vaccine changes may be needed. Trials must
                  also be designed and maintained to allow any changes in
                  efficacy to be assessed, and must be of sufficient scale and
                  diversity to enable clear interpretation of results. Studies
                  of the impact of vaccines as they are deployed are also
                  essential in order to understand their impact.

                  >
                  WHO has been tracking mutations and variants since the start
                  of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our global SARS-CoV-2 laboratory
                  network includes a dedicated Virus Evolution Working Group,
                  which aims to detect new changes quickly and assess their
                  possible impact. Research groups have carried out genomic
                  sequencing of the COVID-19 virus and shared these sequences on
                  public databases, including GISAID. This global collaboration
                  allows scientists to better track how the virus is changing.
                  WHO recommends that all countries increase the sequencing of
                  the COVID-19 virus where possible and share data to help one
                  another monitor and respond to the evolving pandemic. WHO has
                  also established a SARS-CoV-2 Risk Monitoring and Evaluation
                  Framework to identify, monitor and assess variants of concern.
                  It will involve components like surveillance, research on
                  variants of concern, and evaluation of the impact on
                  diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. The framework will
                  serve as a guide for manufacturers and countries on changes
                  that may be needed for COVID-19 vaccines.

                  Stopping the spread at the source remains key. Current
                  measures to reduce transmission – including frequent hand
                  washing, wearing a mask, physical distancing, good ventilation
                  and avoiding crowded places or closed settings – continue to
                  work against new variants by reducing the amount of viral
                  transmission and therefore also reducing opportunities for the
                  virus to mutate. Scaling up vaccine manufacturing and rolling
                  out vaccines as quickly and widely as possible will also be
                  critical ways of protecting people before they are exposed to
                  the virus and the risk of new variants. Priority should be
                  given to vaccinating high-risk groups everywhere to maximize
                  global protection against new variants and minimize the risk
                  of transmission. Moreover, ensuring equitable access to
                  COVID-19 vaccines is more critical than ever to address the
                  evolving pandemic. As more people get vaccinated, we expect
                  virus circulation to decrease, which will then lead to fewer
                  mutations.

                  >
                  Vaccines are a critical tool in the battle against COVID-19,
                  and there are clear public health and lifesaving benefits to
                  using the tools we already have. We must not put off getting
                  vaccinated because of our concerns about new variants, and we
                  must proceed with vaccination even if the vaccines may be
                  somewhat less effective against some of the COVID-19 virus
                  variants. We need to use the tools we have in hand even while
                  we continue to improve those tools. We are all safe only if
                  everyone is safe.

                Xander is a conservative who places great importance on
                authority and the defense budget. He has always defended the
                idea of having a person with a strong personality in power
                (Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Stephen Harper
                are a few examples). A non-dreamy ideologist, he defends the
                idea of a united people open to immigration but not without
                imposing strict rules and selection criteria in harmony with the
                culture, economic needs and the linguistic bases of the people.
                His favorite sport is hockey, hence the many articles on the
                subject.

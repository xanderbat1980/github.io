              <strong>WHAT IS GAS?</strong> Gas refers to the unit that measures
              the amount of computational effort required to execute specific
              operations on the Ethereum network. Since each Ethereum
              transaction requires computational resources to execute, each
              transaction requires a fee. Gas refers to the fee required to
              successfully conduct a transaction on Ethereum.
            </p>

            <p>
              In essence, gas fees are paid in Ethereum's native currency, ether
              (ETH). Gas prices are denoted in gwei, which itself is a
              denomination of ETH - each gwei is equal to 0.000000001 ETH (10-9
              ETH). For example, instead of saying that your gas costs
              0.000000001 ether, you can say your gas costs 1 gwei.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say Alice has to pay Bob 1ETH. In the transaction the gas
              limit is 21,000 units and the gas price is 200 gwei. Total fee
              will be: Gas units (limit) * Gas price per unit i.e 21,000 * 200 =
              4,200,000 gwei or 0.0042 ETH. Now, when Alice sends the money,
              1.0042 ETH will be deducted from Alice's account. Bob will be
              credited 1.0000 ETH. Miner gets 0.0042 ETH.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WHY DO GAS FEES EXIST?</strong> In short, gas fees help
              keep the Ethereum network secure. By requiring a fee for every
              computation executed on the network, we prevent actors from
              spamming the network. In order to prevent accidental or hostile
              infinite loops or other computational wastage in code, each
              transaction is required to set a limit to how many computational
              steps of code execution it can use. The fundamental unit of
              computation is "gas". Although a transaction includes a limit, any
              gas not used in a transaction is returned to the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>WHAT IS GAS LIMIT?</strong> Gas limit refers to the
              maximum amount of gas you are willing to consume on a transaction.
              More complicated transactions, involving smart contracts, require
              more computational work so they require a higher gas limit than a
              simple payment. A standard ETH transfer requires a gas limit of
              21,000 units of gas. For example if you put a gas limit of 50,000
              for a simple ETH transfer, the EVM would consume 21,000, and you
              would get back the remaining 29,000. However, if you specify too
              little gas say for example, a gas limit of 20,000 for a simple ETH
              transfer, the EVM will consume your 20,000 gas units attempting to
              fulfill the txn, but it will not complete. The EVM then reverts
              any changes, but since 20k gas units worth of work has already
              been done by the miner, that gas is consumed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WHAT IS GAS PRICE?</strong> Gas price refers to the amount
              of ether you are willing to pay for every unit of gas, and this is
              usually measured in 'gwei'.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>CAN GAS FEES GET SO HIGH?</strong> High gas fees are due
              to the popularity of Ethereum. Performing any operation on
              Ethereum requires consuming gas, and gas space is limited per
              block. This includes calculations, storing or manipulating data,
              or transferring tokens, each consuming different amounts of "gas"
              units. As dapp functionality grows more complex, the number of
              operations a smart contract performs grows too, meaning each
              transaction takes up more space of a limited size block. If
              there's too much demand, users must offer a higher gas price to
              try and out-bid other users' transactions. A higher price can make
              it more likely that your transaction will get into the next block.
              Gas price alone does not actually determine how much we have to
              pay for a particular transaction. To calculate the transaction fee
              we have to multiply the gas used by gas price, which is measured
              in gwei.

              <strong>INITIATIVE TO REDUCE GAS COSTS</strong> With the new
              network upgrades of Ethereum 2.0 (also known as Eth2 or Serenity).
              This should ultimately address some of the gas fee issues, which
              will in turn enable the platform to process thousands of
              transactions per second and scale globally. Layer 2 scaling is a
              primary initiative to greatly improve gas costs, user experience
              and scalability.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new proof-of-stake model should reduce high power consumption
              and reliance on specialized hardware. The new PoS system was
              introduced on the Beacon Chain. This chain will allow the
              decentralized Ethereum network to come to agreement and keep the
              network secure, but avoid high energy use by requiring a financial
              commitment. Anyone with at least 32 ETH is able to stake them and
              become a validator responsible for processing transactions,
              proposing new blocks to add to the blockchain and storing data.
              Users who have less than 32 ETH are able to join staking pools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>STRATEGIES FOR YOU TO REDUCE GAS COSTS</strong> If you are
              looking to reduce gas costs for your ETH you are able to set the
              price of your own gas fees and choose the priority level of your
              transaction. Miners will 'work on' and execute transactions that
              offer a higher gas price, as they get to keep the fees that you
              pay and will be less inclined to execute transactions with lower
              gas fees set. The gas price you set is how much you are willing to
              pay per unit of gas. However if you set the amount of gas too low
              you will not be able to send your ETH as you will run out of gas,
              you would then have to resubmit your transaction costing you more
              in gas fees. You can do this from some wallet providers when
              sending ETH.

                      Wow Xander. Your article is so simple to understand what
                      does it mean! With your knowledge, what will be the price
                      of ETH in one year?

                        Canadiens@Fan. This is just my opinion but you could
                        decide to buy when the value will be between 25-30
                        thousand dollars (US), for 1 BTC.

                Xander is a conservative who places great importance on
                authority and the defense budget. He has always defended the
                idea of having a person with a strong personality in power
                (Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush and Stephen Harper
                are a few examples). A non-dreamy ideologist, he defends the
                idea of a united people open to immigration but not without
                imposing strict rules and selection criteria in harmony with the
                culture, economic needs and the linguistic bases of the people.
                His favorite sport is hockey, hence the many articles on the
                subject.
